# sorting-simulation

This JavaScript code provides implementations for several popular sorting algorithms, with the added functionality of visualizing the sorting process in a web-based environment using HTML and CSS. 

By calling any of the sorting functions, the array is sorted, and the sorting process is visualized in the browser.
This code is particularly useful for educational purposes, allowing users to see how different sorting algorithms work step by step.
